# Mica

## Device
Use an emulator or a real phone to test the application.
You can easily do this if you follow the steps via [this link](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Make sure you select the right development OS and target OS to avoid problems.

## Set up this project
1. Clone this repository
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/DeMeyerHanne/Mica.git
```

3. Install npm packages (npm install)
```
npm install
```

4. Run the app. I need to run it with npx, but you can run it without npx.
```
npx react-native run-android
```
Or this command if you use an IoS device.
```
npx react-native run-ios
```
